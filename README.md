# rackvol

Load in vol.rkt in DrRacket and build and executable from the menu. That's what I did, it worked on my machine. 

Basically I wanted a clickable interface to the Debian shell command 'amixer set Master X%' where X is an audio output level. 

Racket seemed to be trivial to hack up a GUI in so I did. 

Yes, I do know that the resulting executable is 13 MB and that I could have done it with a script in 2kB or something.
